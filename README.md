# Low-Code ML with Azure ML

This repository provides the supporting code for my presentation entitled [Low-Code ML with Azure ML](https://www.catallaxyservices.com/presentations/low-code-ml-with-azure-ml/).

## Generating Data

This data comes from the [Chicago Parking Ticket database, courtesy of Daniel Hutmacher](https://sqlsunday.com/2022/12/05/new-demo-database/).  I sampled 1,000,000 records from it and [the file I used is available in CSV format](https://cspolybasepublic.blob.core.windows.net/cstrainingpublicdata/ChicagoParkingTickets.txt).

## Running the Code

There are three "cheat sheets" associated with this talk.  These include step-by-step directions and are intended to help me during presentations, but should hopefully provide you with enough guidance to walk through what I did.
